A few assignments and projects I've coded in Java:
- Restaurant_menu implements a basic menu using multiple classes, fields, static and non-static methods, composition, and arrays
- Traveling_Salesperson_Problem was an assignment in class where I only worked in the Tour file and had to use the given classes and work with a linked list to implement the necessary methods to solve TSP as efficiently as possible
- binary_tree_word_cloud creates a word cloud by coding a binary search tree from scratch
